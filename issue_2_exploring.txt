Main development project is failing to properly execute tests again.. trying to explore with the stress test project.

Steps:
-rebuild all
-does not seem to want to rebuild..

-rebuild didn't work, but clean then build has.
-test explorer is discovering..
-run tests

This is what my Development project was doing.  Run tests seem to do ...nothing.

Ohh.. after timeout we get 25 errors!
possibly one error per thread, this CPU has 24 hardware threads.


This is a class of error seen before:
ERROR: [T17] Exception while running tests: System.IO.IOException: The file exists.

I believe that cleaning the temp folder will resolve this, but going to submit this as an issue in the current state.
