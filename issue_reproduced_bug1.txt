Opening the stress test project:

-it has been previously built..
-test discovered

Now to run tests.. interestingly we get 1 error straight away..

(previous capture attempts this morning I had no errors trying to reproduce the issue)

Will wait until the test run completes to see what error it is..


So this is the error where a significant number of tests do not get run..

================
The following errors and warnings have occured during test execution :
